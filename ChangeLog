08/01/2015 Found DisplayService Failing after 24 hours
  - Signal Thread was active
  - DisplayManager thread was active and receiving message
  - do_work() was not cycling; I suspect var host_update_cycle, to be the cause.
  - Reset host_update_cycle to odd number  after each cycle.

08/03/2015 Still Failing after X hours of operation
 - Originally thought it was caused by host_update_cycle int rolling over; not true
 - Considered the delay() sleep method might be failing; wrote my own using nanosleep()
 - Still Failed after updating sleep routines.  Must be Thread interactions...

08/04/2015 Tracking down the cause of main thread freeze.
- sleep(0); suspected to be the cause of the 'uninterruptible sleep' state for main thread
- no other cause I can think of, since tests show no threading conflicts by design and practice.
