# Raspberry Pi Locator Service
Package includes two features. One designed to both locate your Pi and provide a list of known services.  
The other acts as a central LCD display service, allowing other network devices/nodes to send a one-liner 
to the service for display on a 4x20 LCD.


## Build:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
